### Problems in the fourth chapter

#### Problem 10

In Problem P5 you are asked to provide a forwarding table (using longest prefix matching). Rewrite this forwarding table using the a.b.c.d/x notation instead of the binary string notation.

***Answer:*** 

|  IP Dst   | Interface |
| :-------: | :-------: |
| 224.0/10  |     0     |
| 224.64/16 |     1     |
|   224/8   |     2     |
| 225.128/9 |     3     |
|   o.w.    |     3     |



#### Problem 16

Consider the network setup in **Figure 4.25** . Suppose that the ISP instead assigns the router the address 24.34.112.235 and that the network address of the home network is 192.168.1/24.

> a. Assign addresses to all interfaces in the home network. 

***Answer:*** Home addresses: 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3.

The router interface: 192.168.1.4.

> b. Suppose each host has two ongoing TCP connections, all to port 80 at host 128.119.40.86. Provide the six corresponding entries in the NAT translation table.

***Answer:*** The NAT transformation table is as followed:

|      WLAN Side      |     LAN Side      |
| :-----------------: | :---------------: |
| 24.34.112.235, 4000 | 192.168.1.1, 3345 |
| 24.34.112.235, 4001 | 192.168.1.1, 3346 |
| 24.34.112.235, 4002 | 192.168.1.2, 3445 |
| 24.34.112.235, 4003 | 192.168.1.2, 3446 |
| 24.34.112.235, 4004 | 192.168.1.3, 3445 |
| 24.34.112.235, 4005 | 192.168.1.3, 3446 |



#### Problem 19

Consider the SDN OpenFlow network shown in **Figure 4.30** . Suppose that the desired forwarding behavior for datagrams arriving at s2 is as follows:

- any datagrams arriving on input port 1 from hosts h5 or h6 that are destined to hosts h1 or h2 should be forwarded over output port 2;

- any datagrams arriving on input port 2 from hosts h1 or h2 that are destined to hosts h5 or h6 should be forwarded over output port 1;

- any arriving datagrams on input ports 1 or 2 and destined to hosts h3 or h4 should be delivered to the host specified;

- hosts h3 and h4 should be able to send datagrams to each other.

Specify the flow table entries in s2 that implement this forwarding behavior.

***Answer:*** The s2 flow table is as followed:

|                          Match                          |   Action   |
| :-----------------------------------------------------: | :--------: |
| Ingress Port: 1; IP Src: 10.3.\*.\*; IP Dst: 10.1.\*.\* | Forward(2) |
| Ingress Port: 2; IP Src: 10.1.\*.\*; IP Dst: 10.3.\*.\* | Forward(1) |
|            Ingress Port: 1; IP Dst: 10.2.0.3            | Forward(3) |
|            Ingress Port: 2; IP Dst: 10.2.0.3            | Forward(3) |
|   Ingress Port: 4; IP Src=10.2.0.4; IP Dst: 10.2.0.3    | Forward(3) |
|            Ingress Port: 1; IP Dst: 10.2.0.4            | Forward(4) |
|            Ingress Port: 2; IP Dst: 10.2.0.4            | Forward(4) |
|   Ingress Port: 3; IP Src=10.2.0.3; IP Dst: 10.2.0.4    | Forward(4) |
