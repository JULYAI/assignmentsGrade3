### Problems in the fifth chapter

#### Problem 14

Consider the network shown below. Suppose AS3 and AS2 are running OSPF for their intra-AS routing protocol. Suppose AS1 and AS4 are running RIP for their intra-AS routing protocol. Suppose eBGP and iBGP are used for the inter-AS routing protocol. Initially suppose there is *no* physical link between AS2 and AS4.

> a. Router 3c learns about prefix *x* from which routing protocol: OSPF, RIP, eBGP, or iBGP?

***Answer:*** Since 3c is gateway router, the answer is eBGP.

> b. Router 3a learns about *x* from which routing protocol?

***Answer:*** Since 3a is Internet router, the answer is iBGP.

> c. Router 1c learns about *x* from which routing protocol?

***Answer:*** Since 1c is gateway router, the answer is eBGP.

> d. Router 1d learns about *x* from which routing protocol?

***Answer:*** Since 1d is Internet router, the answer is iBGP.



#### Problem 15

 Referring to the previous problem, once router 1d learns about *x* it will put an entry (*x*, *I*) in its forwarding table.

> a. Will *I* be equal to *I*1 or *I*2 for this entry? Explain why in one sentence.

***Answer:*** Since *I*1 is the interface that begins the least cost path from 1d to gateway router 1c, *I* will be equal to *I*1.

> b. Now suppose that there is a physical link between AS2 and AS4, shown by the dotted line. Suppose router 1d learns that *x* is accessible via AS2 as well as via AS3. Will *I* be set to *I*1 or *I*2? Explain why in one sentence.

***Answer:*** Since *I*1 has the same AS-PATH length as *I*2, while I2 begins the nearest path to NEXT-HOP router, *I* will be set to *I*2.

> c. Now suppose there is another AS, called AS5, which lies on the path between AS2 and AS4 (not shown in diagram). Suppose router 1d learns that *x* is accessible via AS2 AS5 AS4 as well as via AS3 AS4. Will *I* be set to *I*1 or *I*2? Explain why in one sentence.

***Answer:*** Since at this moment, the least length of the AS-PATH that the path *I*1 begins has is less than the path *I*2 begins has, so *I* will be set to *I*1.
